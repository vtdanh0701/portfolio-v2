                    Iâ€™m naturally inquisitive and enjoy figuring out how things work. I have a defined sense of aesthetic and enjoy making thoughtful, engaging, and functional web applications that have a simple, clean and distinct design.

                <p>
                    I have experience with various technologies, and I am currently specializing in <span className='about-highlight'>JavaScript</span> and <span className='about-highlight'>ReactJS. </span>
                    I have designed, developed and deployed web applications using multiple modern tools and frameworks such as ReactJs, Expressjs, Bootstrap, Sass ..etc...

                    When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing piano or hanging out with my friends and family.
