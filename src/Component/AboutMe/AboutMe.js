                    I have experience with various technologies, and I am currently specializing in Javascript and ReactJS. 
                    I have designed, developed and deployed web applications using multiple modern tools and frameworks such as ReactJs, Expressjs, Bootstrap, Sass ..etc...

                    When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing piano or hanging out with my friends and family.
